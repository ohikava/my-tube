These one of my best projects with Web Development. It is my try to cope a youtube's functionality. As a planned you should be able to watch videos, comment them, like, dislike, follow and unfollow creators, add your video on your channel, change theme, language, search for a video on the search bar. Unfortunately, I lost my interest in thise project and web development in total, so I stopped commiting in this repository. Hovewer, part of what I wantet I realised so I have something to show you.

You need to download it from the repository, input "npm i" in console for installing all required modules, input "node app.js" for running a server, then input "npm run start" for running frontend
